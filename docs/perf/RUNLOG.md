# SpaceGraph — Master-Prompt Run Log

One section per phase: what changed, gate results with numbers, and any
deviations from the master prompt (each with a one-line justification).

---

## Phase 0 — Baseline, diagnostics, bench harness

Branch: `chore/v0.1.x-baseline`.

### Changed

* Added a library target (`src/lib.rs`) exposing the viewer modules so
  benches/tests can construct `GraphState` without a running Bevy app; `main.rs`
  is now a thin boot wrapper that also parses `--demo-load <n>`.
* `graph/synthetic.rs` — deterministic synthetic-graph generator (seeded
  SplitMix64, zero new runtime deps). `n` nodes / ~`2n` edges.
* `GraphState::load_synthetic_graph(n)` + `--demo-load <n>` flag (seeds the
  synthetic graph instead of auto-connecting agents).
* `benches/layout.rs` — criterion benches for `force_step` and
  `visible_set_capped` at 500/1000/2000/5000.
* **Edge-visibility bug fixed** in `graph/layout.rs`: connectivity-aware
  deterministic BFS cap (`cap_visible_set_connected`) replaces the lexicographic
  truncation that dropped every process node. See `BASELINE.md` for the full
  root-cause analysis.

### Gate 0 results

* `cargo test --workspace`: green (38 viewer tests incl. 3 new edge-bug
  regression tests + synthetic generator tests; agent/core suites green).
* `cargo fmt --check`: clean.
* `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`: clean.
* `cargo bench -p spacegraph-viewer`: runs; baseline numbers in `BASELINE.md`.
* Edge-bug root cause documented and fixed (viewer-local, no protocol change).

### Deviations

* Added `criterion` as a **dev-dependency** (not a runtime dep). Justification:
  Phase 0 explicitly requires "criterion benches"; it is test-only and does not
  affect the shipped binary. Used with `default-features = false` (+
  `cargo_bench_support`) to avoid pulling plotters/rayon.
* Introduced `src/lib.rs`. Justification: the viewer was a binary-only crate;
  criterion benches and unit tests need to import `GraphState`. This is a
  structural (move-only) change required by the Phase 0 bench mandate; runtime
  behaviour is unchanged.
